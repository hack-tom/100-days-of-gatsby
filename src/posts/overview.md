The 100 Days of Gatsby challenge is designed to equip a developer with all the skills they need to launch a comprehensive Gatsby site - as well as forming a rather lovely portfolio piece.

Previously, I had completed the first 7 challenges back in May of 2020, but due to a global pandemic and some controversies in the Gatsby organisation, I had decided not to complete it at that time. Having recently graduated, I'm now in a position where I'm more open to devoting time to the project, hence this latest series.

### The Stages

The 100 Days of Gatsby title is a little bit misleading, and it did cause me some confusion at first. The challenges are not daily, but weekly - perhaps a more suitable title would be "The 15 Weeks of Gatsby Challenge" - which are as follows:

* [Track Your Progress with a Blazingly Fast Blog](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/100days-start-blog)
* [Host Your Gatsby Site for Free](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/100days-free-hosting)
* [Auto-Optimize Images on Your Gatsby Site](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/100days-gatsby-image)

There was also a Gatsby Wizard named Paul Scanlon that [took the 100 Days of Gatsby Challenge a little bit more literally](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/2020-04-20-paulie-scanlons-journey-of-100-days), completing a project every 10 days, for 100 days straight - complete with a daily blog post.
